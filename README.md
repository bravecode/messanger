This app is not 100% finished and will not be because I've achieved all my MVP goals. What could I do better? A lot. But I'm satisfied with the overall outcome of this project.

I've learned a lot. It was my first project in Go, so this is probably the area I've gained the most knowledge. It was also the first time I've used Redis. Originally I started with SQL, but I decided to switch in the middle because in-memory database seemed very interesting. This stack appealed to me so much that I will definitely use it in the future and maybe go for a full-stack development with Go as the primary back-end. I love strongly typed languages.

If it comes to the client, I've decided to use Redux & Saga. Of course, it's overkill for this size of an application, but it made handling side effects in the application easy, with the only disadvantage being - much more code to write.

## Tech Stack
- Go (with Fiber)
- Redis as a DB
- React (with Redux, Saga)
- Tailwind
